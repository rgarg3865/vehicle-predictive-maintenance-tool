# 🚗 Predictive Car Maintenance (ML Project)

## Overview
This project explores **predictive maintenance for cars** using machine learning.  
The goal is to predict the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of engine oil based on driving behavior and usage patterns.

This is an **AI/ML-focused project** inspired by real-world predictive maintenance systems used in industry.

---

## Problem Statement
Car maintenance is usually based on fixed intervals (e.g. every 5,000 miles), but real wear depends heavily on:
- Driving style
- Usage patterns
- Operating conditions

This project aims to learn those patterns and **predict when maintenance is actually needed**, rather than relying on static rules.

---

## Initial Scope (Day 1)
- Focus on **oil change prediction**
- Use **synthetic, physics-inspired data**
- Predict **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** in miles
- Monthly time-step per vehicle

Future extensions will include uncertainty estimation, sequence models, and explainability.

---

## Planned Approach
1. Simulate realistic vehicle usage over time  
2. Model oil degradation using domain-informed assumptions  
3. Train ML models to predict RUL  
4. Evaluate accuracy and analyze feature importance  

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python
- NumPy, pandas
- scikit-learn
- PyTorch (later phase)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Project Status
🚧 **In progress**  
Currently setting up repository structure and defining simulation logic.

## Motivation
This project combines:
- A strong interest in cars and engines
- Applied machine learning
- Real-world system modeling

The focus is not just accuracy, but **reasoning, assumptions, and interpretability**.
